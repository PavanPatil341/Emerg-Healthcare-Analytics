## From the Analysis of Healthcare Demographics and the Analysis of medical devices there are a total of 50 hospitals across 8 regions in Canada.
## Analysis
* As we can see the first visualization shows the tree map showing region wise total medical device where patient monitors are of 291 and ventilators are of 220 which are at highest count and MRI scanners and c-arms are of lowest count so need to focus accordingly.
* In the second visualization we can see that ownership wise hospitals a total of 25 public ,20 private and 5 non-profit hospitals are present across 50 hospitals.

* Larger hospitals with more beds might have higher demand for medical devices, but smaller hospitals could also represent opportunities, especially for specialized equipment.
